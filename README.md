# reqtest_manage_text README

## Overview
ReqTest-Manage-Text is a human-readable syntax for managing requirements, tests, and project management. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing users to create, edit, and manage their requirements, tests and projects in a text format. 

## Core Philosophy

> **RequiremenTest (ReqTest) Definition**: A feature with a expected functionality that must be achieved, and the test that prove it was achieved.

The core philosophy at the heart of Text-ReqTest-Manager is that when taking on a task there are two questions that go hand in hand:
1. **What is it supposed to do?**
2. **How do you know it does it?**

These two questions are the basis of the ReqTest definition. The requirements and tests are the two sides of the same coin and need to be managed together.


## Features
- **Text Based:** The syntax is text based for human readability and ease of use. The user will be able to manually update their projects from the text editor, as well as through the application.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** The reqtest objects are organized in a hierarchical structure based on levels. This allows for easy navigation, and manipulation of the objects. 
    - Benefits:
        - Easy to add, remove and modify requirements and tests.
        - Easy regroup and reassign requirements and tests.
- **Querable Structure:** The text is structured in a way that allows for easy querying and searching. This will allow for easy navigation and management of the project objects.
