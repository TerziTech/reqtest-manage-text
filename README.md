# reqtest_manage_text README

## Overview
ReqTest-Manage-Text is a human-readable syntax for managing requirements, tests, and project management. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing users to create, edit, and manage their requirements, tests and projects in a text format. 

## Core Philosophy

> **RequiremenTest (ReqTest) Definition**: A feature with a expected functionality that must be achieved, and the test that prove it was achieved.

The core philosophy at the heart of Text-ReqTest-Manager is that when taking on a task there are two questions that go hand in hand:
1. **What is it supposed to do?**
2. **How do you know it does it?**

These two questions are the basis of the ReqTest definition. The requirements and tests are the two sides of the same coin and need to be managed together.


## Features
- **Text Based:** The syntax is text based for human readability and ease of use. The user will be able to manually update their projects from the text editor, as well as through the application.
- **Querable Structure:** The text is structured in a way that allows for easy querying and searching. This will allow for easy navigation and management of the project objects.
- **Version Control:** The system supports version control for tracking major and minor changes to the project main file. 
- **Design Documentation:** The system supports design documentation for the project. This will allow for easy tracking of the design and architecture of the project tied to the project main file.

## rmt syntax

Each reqtest object is defined in a text file with the following syntax:

- Blocks are defined by `.'.`
- The first line with the start block is the name of the block.
- After the name of the block, each following field in the block is indented with a tab.
- Each field is defined by a key and a value separated by a `: `.

### Example reqtest block
```plaintext

.'. {reqtest_name}
    reqtest_id: {reqtest_id} 
    description: {description}
    owner: {owner}
    status: {status}
    detail: {detail}
    test_criteria: {test_criteria}
.'.
```

## Terminal Commands for ReqTest-Manage-Text - rmt

### rmt init
The `rmt init` command initializes a new project in the current directory. It creates a new file called `project.rmt` and sets up the necessary structure for the project.

### rmt add
The `rmt add` command adds a new reqtest object to the project.rmt file from the `docs/reqtesttemplate.rmt` template. The command will prompt the user for the name of the reqtest object, which will replace the `{reqtest_name}` placeholder in the template. The new reqtest object will be added to the `project.rmt` file with a new line after the last reqtest object. 
 - A unique id will be generated by using the date time and a random set of three letters to replace the `{reqtest_id}` placeholder in the template. The date time will be formatted as `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

```bash
rmt add
```

### rmt list
The `rmt list` command lists all the reqtest objects in the project.rmt file. The command will read the project.rmt file and print the name of each reqtest object to the terminal.

```bash
rmt list
```

### rmt remove

The `rmt remove` command removes a reqtest object from the project.rmt file. The command will prompt the user for the name of the reqtest object to remove. The reqtest object will be removed from the project.rmt file.

- The command will also provide feedback if the reqtest object does not exist in the project.rmt file.


```bash
rmt remove
```

### rmt details

The `rmt details` command provides detailed information about a specific reqtest object. It prompts the user for the name of the reqtest object and displays its associated details.
- The command will allow for tab completion of the reqtest object name.
- The command will also provide feedback if the reqtest object does not exist in the project.rmt file.
