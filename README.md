# reqtest_manage_text README

## Overview
ReqTest-Manage-Text is a human-readable syntax for managing requirements, tests, and project management. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing users to create, edit, and manage their requirements, tests and projects in a text format. 

## Core Philosophy

> **RequiremenTest (ReqTest) Definition**: A feature with a expected functionality that must be achieved, and the test that prove it was achieved.

The core philosophy at the heart of Text-ReqTest-Manager is that when taking on a task there are two questions that go hand in hand:
1. **What is it supposed to do?**
2. **How do you know it does it?**

These two questions are the basis of the ReqTest definition. The requirements and tests are the two sides of the same coin and need to be managed together.


## Features
- **Text Based:** The syntax is text based for human readability and ease of use. The user will be able to manually update their projects from the text editor, as well as through the application.
- **Querable Structure:** The text is structured in a way that allows for easy querying and searching. This will allow for easy navigation and management of the project objects.
- **Version Control:** The system supports version control for tracking major and minor changes to the project main file. 
- **Design Documentation:** The system supports design documentation for the project. This will allow for easy tracking of the design and architecture of the project tied to the project main file.

## Terminal Commands for ReqTest-Manage-Text - rmt

### rmt init
The `rmt init` command initializes a new project in the current directory. It creates a new file called `project.rmt` and sets up the necessary structure for the project.

```bash
rmt init
```

### rmt add
The `rmt add` command adds a new reqtest object to the project.rmt file from the `docs/reqtesttemplate.rmt` template. The command will prompt the user for the name of the reqtest object, which will replace the `{reqtest_name}` placeholder in the template. The new reqtest object will be added to the `project.rmt` file with a new line after the last reqtest object. 
 - A unique id will be generated by using the date time and a random set of three letters to replace the `{reqtest_id}` placeholder in the template. The date time will be formatted as `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

```bash
rmt add
```
